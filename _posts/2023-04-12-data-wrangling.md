## Overview

In this session, we give a basic introduction to R, and its usefulness
when handling data. We cover fundamental data structures in R, 
along with basic visualizations. We extend these techniques to work with
larger GIS data.

This session is presented by Ben.

***Objectives***: After this session, we hope you will be able to:
> - Learn basic R functions and data structures
> - Learn how to read and visualize data in R
> - Get help in R
> - Use R on GIS data
> - Understand early stages of the data analysis pipeline by playing with data

## 1. Getting Started

Before we really get going with topological data analysis, 
we first need a basic understanding of how to handle data in R.

We will be working with R online in [R Studio Cloud](https://login.rstudio.cloud/),
though if you'd prefer to work in R Studio locally that is fine too. Create an account,
this is probably easiest using your google account, and start working in the `posit cloud`.

After logging in, select a workspace or create a new one.
Once in your workspace, begin by clicking `New Project` (top right) and selecting
a `New RStudio Project` from the dropdown menu.
Finally, at the top of the page, click `Untitled Project` and rename your
project `T4DS-Workshop-2023`. Then use
`File -> New File -> R Script` (or `Ctrl+Shift+N`) to create a new R script. Use
`File -> Save` to save the file. You'll be prompted to enter a file name. Use
`R-Intro`.

Throughout this tutorial, we will add code to R-Intro.R.  Be sure to use
`Ctrl+S` to save as you go!

### Fundamentals of R

R is a multi-paradigm (object-oriented, functional, array) language
developed for statistical computing. It is heavily influenced from S,
Scheme (a dialect of lisp), and APL. Its syntax comes from its predecessor S, it
takes lexical scoping from Scheme, and it allows for array-programming
style like Matlab and APL. It is an object-oriented programming
language, and list objects serve as a fundamental storage object in
which many other objects derive from. It is also a functional
programming language, and so functions are first-class citizens that
can be passed around like any other object. We will begin by showing 
some of these basics.

First, anything in R is an object. For example a vector with elements
1, 2, and 3 can be instantiated using the concatenate function `c()`:

```r
c(1, 2, 3)
```

<details>
<summary style="color:blue">Expected Output</summary>
<br>
<pre style="background-color:lightblue">
<code>
> c(1, 2, 3)
[1] 1 2 3
</code>
</pre>
</details>

We can assign this to an object named `a` using the assignment operator `<-`
and then print out the object by running the line with the object on it or by making 
a call to the `print()` function.

```r
a <- c(1, 2, 3)
a
print(a)
```

<details>
<summary style="color:blue">Expected Output</summary>
<br>
<pre style="background-color:lightblue">
<code>
> a
[1] 1 2 3

> print(a)
[1] 1 2 3
</code>
</pre>
</details>

You can use the `=` sign like in other languages for object
assignment, but it is typically frowned upon from a style perspective,
as that is typically reserved for named arguments in a function.

As stated previously, lists are a fundamental object type in R, in which
many objects derive from. We can construct a list in the following way:

```r
my_list <- list(a = a, b = 52)
my_list
```

<details>
<summary style="color:blue">Expected Output</summary>
<br>
<pre style="background-color:lightblue">
<code>
> my_list
$a
[1] 1 2 3

$b
[1] 52
</code>
</pre>
</details>

Here, we created a list, named `my_list` with two elements named `a`
and `b`. We can now access these elements one of two equivalent ways,
using the `$` operator or the double square-bracket operator `[[]]`:

```r
my_list$a

my_list[['a']]
```

<details>
<summary style="color:blue">Expected Output</summary>
<br>
<pre style="background-color:lightblue">
<code>
> my_list$a
[1] 1 2 3
> my_list[['a']]
[1] 1 2 3
> 
</code>
</pre>
</details>


We can define a simple add-one function in the following way:

```r
my_fun <- function(x) {
    ret <- x + 1
    return(ret)
}

my_fun(3)
```


<details>
<summary style="color:blue">Expected Output</summary>
<br>
<pre style="background-color:lightblue">
<code>
> my_fun(3)
[1] 4
</code>
</pre>
</details>

Since functions are objects like any other object, notice we assign
them like any other object. We can also add them as an element (named
`f`) in our list in the following way: 

```r
my_list$f <- my_fun

# Equivalently:
# my_list[['f']] <- my_fun
```

Since both objects (`my_list$f` and `my_fun`) are in scope, we can
call either function and expect the same output:

```r
my_list$f(2.3)

my_fun(2.3)
```

<details>
<summary style="color:blue">Expected Output</summary>
<br>
<pre style="background-color:lightblue">
<code>
> my_list$f(2.3)
[1] 3.3
> my_fun(2.3)
[1] 3.3
</code>
</pre>
</details>

When programming in R, you are often faced with the situation that you
have been handed an object, but do not know what is insided the
object. To find out what is in the object, we can conduct 'object
introspection' using the `str()` function:

```r
str(my_list)
```

<details>
<summary style="color:blue">Expected Output</summary>
<br>
<pre style="background-color:lightblue">
<code>
> str(my_list)
List of 3
 $ a: num [1:3] 1 2 3
 $ b: num 52
 $ f:function (x)  
  ..- attr(*, "srcref")= 'srcref' int [1:8] 1 11 4 1 11 1 1 4
  .. ..- attr(*, "srcfile")=Classes 'srcfilecopy', 'srcfile' <environment: 0x5582689d7c08> 
</code>
</pre>
</details>

Notice that the `str()` function has told us that the object `my_list`
is a list object with 3 elements, `a`, `b` and `f`. It also tells us
that `a` is a numeric vector with 3 elements and lists those elements
out, `b` is a numeric value, and `f` is a function.

### Getting help

We have already used a couple of functions, namely `c()` and
`list()`. How do we know how these functions work you may ask?
We can find out in two way. First, every function that comes from a
library (or base R) likely has good documentation. You can access
that documentation by running the `help()` function or equivalently
by putting a question mark before the name of the function:

```r
?list

# Equivalently:
# help(list)
```

Lists - Generic and Dotted Pairs

Description:

     Functions to construct, coerce and check for both kinds of R
     lists.

Usage:

     list(...)
     pairlist(...)
     
     as.list(x, ...)
     ## S3 method for class 'environment'
     as.list(x, all.names = FALSE, sorted = FALSE, ...)
     as.pairlist(x)
     
     is.list(x)
     is.pairlist(x)
     
     alist(...)
     
Arguments:

     ...: objects, possibly named.

       x: object to be coerced or tested.

all.names: a logical indicating whether to copy all values or (default)
          only those whose names do not begin with a dot.

  sorted: a logical indicating whether the ‘names’ of the resulting
          list should be sorted (increasingly).  Note that this is
          somewhat costly, but may be useful for comparison of
          environments.

Details:

     Almost all lists in R internally are _Generic Vectors_, whereas
     traditional _dotted pair_ lists (as in LISP) remain available but
     rarely seen by users (except as ‘formals’ of functions).

     The arguments to ‘list’ or ‘pairlist’ are of the form ‘value’ or
     ‘tag = value’.  The functions return a list or dotted pair list
     composed of its arguments with each value either tagged or
     untagged, depending on how the argument was specified.

     ‘alist’ handles its arguments as if they described function
     arguments.  So the values are not evaluated, and tagged arguments
     with no value are allowed whereas ‘list’ simply ignores them.
     ‘alist’ is most often used in conjunction with ‘formals’.

     ‘as.list’ attempts to coerce its argument to a list.  For
     functions, this returns the concatenation of the list of formal
     arguments and the function body.  For expressions, the list of
     constituent elements is returned.  ‘as.list’ is generic, and as
     the default method calls ‘as.vector(mode = "list")’ for a
     non-list, methods for ‘as.vector’ may be invoked.  ‘as.list’ turns
     a factor into a list of one-element factors, keeping ‘names’.
     Other attributes may be dropped unless the argument already is a
     list or expression.  (This is inconsistent with functions such as
     ‘as.character’ which always drop attributes, and is for efficiency
     since lists can be expensive to copy.)

     ‘is.list’ returns ‘TRUE’ if and only if its argument is a ‘list’
     _or_ a ‘pairlist’ of ‘length’ > 0.  ‘is.pairlist’ returns ‘TRUE’
     if and only if the argument is a pairlist or ‘NULL’ (see below).

     The ‘"environment"’ method for ‘as.list’ copies the name-value
     pairs (for names not beginning with a dot) from an environment to
     a named list.  The user can request that all named objects are
     copied.  Unless ‘sorted = TRUE’, the list is in no particular
     order (the order depends on the order of creation of objects and
     whether the environment is hashed).  No enclosing environments are
     searched.  (Objects copied are duplicated so this can be an
     expensive operation.)  Note that there is an inverse operation,
     the ‘as.environment()’ method for list objects.

     An empty pairlist, ‘pairlist()’ is the same as ‘NULL’.  This is
     different from ‘list()’: some but not all operations will promote
     an empty pairlist to an empty list.

     ‘as.pairlist’ is implemented as ‘as.vector(x, "pairlist")’, and
     hence will dispatch methods for the generic function ‘as.vector’.
     Lists are copied element-by-element into a pairlist and the names
     of the list used as tags for the pairlist: the return value for
     other types of argument is undocumented.

     ‘list’, ‘is.list’ and ‘is.pairlist’ are primitive functions.

     Language_.  Wadsworth & Brooks/Cole.

See Also:

     ‘vector("list", length)’ for creation of a list with empty
     components; ‘c’, for concatenation; ‘formals’.  ‘unlist’ is an
     approximate inverse to ‘as.list()’.

     ‘plotmath’ for the use of ‘list’ in plot annotation.

Examples:

     require(graphics)
     
     # create a plotting structure
     pts <- list(x = cars[,1], y = cars[,2])
     plot(pts)
     
     is.pairlist(.Options)  # a user-level pairlist
     
     ## "pre-allocate" an empty list of length 5
     vector("list", 5)
     
     # Argument lists
     f <- function() x
     # Note the specification of a "..." argument:
     formals(f) <- al <- alist(x = , y = 2+3, ... = )
     f
     al
     
     ## environment->list coercion
     
     e1 <- new.env()
     e1$a <- 10
     e1$b <- 20
     as.list(e1)

This documentation can be a lot to look at the first time, but the
important sections to pay attention to are the function signature,
argument descriptions, and example code at the end. If you don't know
what a function does, looking at the help documentation is the first
thing you should do.

A more involved way to find out what a function does is to read its
source code, which you can do by calling the name of the function. Both
`list()` and `c()` are primative functions, and so we won't get much information
about these objects in this way:

```r
list
```

Finally, most objects you encounter in R will be of one of two
classes, either `S3` or `S4`. If you want to specifically create class
objects, there are relevant details which we con't cover. However,
when working with objects, just know that for `S3` class objects, you
access elements of the object with the `$` operator and with `S4` class objects, 
you access elements with the `@` operator. If you run the `str()` function on
an object and see `@` symbols instated of `$` symbols, just know that
you are dealing with an `S4` class object.

### Reading Data into R

Let's get started with some basic CSV data. It turns out, there is a really easy command
to import csv data in R, and we can even do it directly from a webpage.
In this workshop, we like glaciers a lot,
and we can download some glacier data natively in R as follows:

```
glacier_csv <- 'https://pkgstore.datahub.io/core/glacier-mass-balance/glaciers_csv/data/c04ec0dab848ef8f9b179a2cca11b616/glaciers_csv.csv'

# this data has a header, so we set header=TRUE to keep it out of the rest of our data

This data is a collection, on average, of the cumulative mass balance of glaciers worldwide.
The cumulative mass balance is a measure of the health of a glacier, and is a weighted difference
between yearly mass gain (snow accumulation), and yearly mass loss (melting).
We can see that each entry is comprised of a year, an average value, and the number of observations. 

And see what class the data is with:

```
class(glacier_data)
```

<details style="color:blue">
<summary>Expected Output</summary>
<br>
<pre style="background-color:lightblue">
<code>

[1] "data.frame"
</code>
</pre>
</details>



Data frames are a central concept in R programming, and the next section shows us some of the things
we can do with them.

---

### Fundamental Data Structures in R

We can get a sense of the size of our data running:

```
dim(glacier_data)
```

<details>
<summary style="color:blue">Expected Output</summary>
<br>
<pre style="background-color:lightblue">
<code>
> dim(glacier_data)
[1] 70  3
</code>
</pre>
</details>


This told us that our data has 70 rows, and 3 columns. 
Note that in R, indices start at 1, and not at 0!
If we're working with large data and want to get a feel for things, the
`head` function is quite useful:

```
# grab the first 5 rows of glacier_data
head(glacier_data, 5)
```

<details>
<summary style="color:blue">Expected Output</summary>
<br>
<pre style="background-color:lightblue">
<code>
> head(glacier_data, 5)
  Year Mean.cumulative.mass.balance Number.of.observations
1 1945                         0.00                     NA
2 1946                        -1.13                      1
3 1947                        -3.19                      1
4 1948                        -3.19                      1
5 1949                        -3.82                      3
</code>
</pre>
</details>

Wasn't that easier to digest than looking at the whole thing?

We can also grab
entries by row, column index as follows:

```
# row 1, column 1
glacier_data[1,1]

# row 27, column 3
glacier_data[27,3]
```
<details>
<summary style="color:blue">Expected Output</summary>
<br>
<pre style="background-color:lightblue">
<code>
> # row 1, column 1
> glacier_data[1,1]
[1] 1945
> # row 27, column 3
> glacier_data[27,3]
[1] 32
</code>
</pre>
</details>



We can pull multiple entries out
of a dataframe with `c()` the "combine" function in R as well, that is,

```
# grab rows 2,3,5 and columns 2,3
glacier_data[c(2, 3, 5), c(2, 3)]
```

<details>
<summary style="color:blue">Expected Output</summary>
<br>
<pre style="background-color:lightblue">
<code>
> glacier_data[c(2, 3, 5), c(2, 3)]
  Mean.cumulative.mass.balance Number.of.observations
2                        -1.13                      1
3                        -3.19                      1
5                        -3.82                      3
</code>
</pre>
</details>



If we want contiguous rows and columns, we can also use:

```
# grab rows 4 through 10, and all 3 columns
glacier_data[4:10, 1:3]
```



Finally, if we want all rows or all columns,
we can leave indices blank:

```
# grab only row 2
glacier_data[2,]
```

Therein lies R data manipulation in a nutshell!

### Fundamental Visualizations in R

As the programming language of choice for statisticians, it should come as no surprise that one can also
easily get statistical summaries from data.

Basic functions like `min`, `max`, `sd` (for standard deviation), and `mean` allow us to grab statistical properties from our
data. For example:

```
# get min cumulative mass balance
min(glacier_data[,2])

# get mean
mean(glacier_data[,2])
```

<details>
<summary style="color:blue">Expected Output</summary>
<br>
<pre style="background-color:lightblue">
<code>
> min(glacier_data[,2])
[1] -28.652
> mean(glacier_data[,2])
[1] -12.84216
</code>
</pre>
</details>


For a more comprehensive summary, we can use the `summary` function.

```
summary(glacier_data)
```

<details>
<summary style="color:blue">Expected Output</summary>
<br>
<pre style="background-color:lightblue">
<code>
> summary(glacier_data)
      Year      Mean.cumulative.mass.balance Number.of.observations
 Min.   :1945   Min.   :-28.652              Min.   : 1.00

 Median :1980   Median :-11.223              Median :36.00         
 Mean   :1980   Mean   :-12.842              Mean   :27.75         
 3rd Qu.:1997   3rd Qu.: -9.136              3rd Qu.:37.00         
 Max.   :2014   Max.   :  0.000              Max.   :37.00         
                                             NA's   :1  
</code>
</pre>
</details>

If we want to visualize our data in a plot, we can do so using the `plot`
function, which is intended for scatterplots. Let's plot
the cumulative mass balance vs. year, with year on the x-axis and 
average cumulative mass balance on the y-axis:

```
# view cumulative mass balance vs year
plot(x=glacier_data[,1], y=glacier_data[,2])
```

We can make the plot prettier by labelling axes and giving a title:

```
plot(x=glacier_data[,1], y=glacier_data[,2], xlab="Year", ylab = "Cumulative Mass Balance", main ="Glacier Health vs. Time")
```

The research does show that glaciers around the world are melting and getting
smaller; see, e.g.,
[climate.gov](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-mountain-glaciers). 
Tomorrow, we will explore the
relationship between shape and glacier health.

## 2. Working with GIS Data in R

Now that we have some basic data analysis in R under our belt, we start working with GIS data,
which is a bit more complex!

---

### Some GIS Data to Play With: Montana Counties

For this tutorial, we will work with GIS data coming from Montana County boundaries.
We will download the data directly into R as before, which comes from
[Montana.gov](https://ftpgeoinfo.msl.mt.gov/Data/Spatial/MSDI/AdministrativeBoundaries/).

Unfortunately, it is less easy to do so with GIS data than with a standard CSV.
First, we download the .zip file into `MontanaCounties.zip`, and then unzip it in our cloud project:

```
download.file("https://ftpgeoinfo.msl.mt.gov/Data/Spatial/MSDI/AdministrativeBoundaries/MontanaCounties_shp.zip", destfile = "/cloud/project/MontanaCounties.zip")
system("unzip /cloud/project/MontanaCounties.zip")
```

You should see the .zip file be downloaded in your working directory, and then
the directory `MontanaCounties_shp` should be created after it is unzipped.

To manipulate shape data, we will use the `rgdal` and the `spatial polygons` library.
Download and import the library `gdal` library, and import `sp` which is a built-in library in R:

`NOTE: The rgdal library has recently been retired. Former versions can be downloaded at the address below. We are working actively on a transition to an alternate package.`

Old versions of the library are available [here](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/rgdal/).

```
install.packages("rgdal")
library(rgdal)
library(sp)
```

Now open the shapefile using the `rgdal` function `readOGR`:

```
counties <- readOGR(dsn="/cloud/project/MontanaCounties_shp/County.shp")
# understand the format of our data
class(counties)
dim(counties)
```

<details>
<summary style="color:blue">Expected Output</summary>
<br>
<pre style="background-color:lightblue">
<code>
> class(counties)
[1] "SpatialPolygonsDataFrame"
attr(,"package")
[1] "sp"
> dim(counties)
[1] 56 15                                      NA's   :1  
</code>
</pre>
</details>

We can see that we're working now with a new type of data: `sp` data or "spatial data".
Thankfully, this data inherits lots of the same funtionality from dataframes. We can see
that we're working with a more complex matrix as well; this one has 56 rows and 15 columns.

Unlike our CSV data, shapefile data is much more unweildy.
For a better sense of this, take a look at the first few entries of `counties`:

```
head(counties, 3)
```

Clearly, this GIS data is more involved to wrap one's mind around.
However, don't despair, many others have come before you and successfully dealt with GIS data in R.
In fact, R has a built-in function to plot GIS data which is quite satisfying:

```
plot(counties)
```

<details>
<summary style="color:blue">Expected Output</summary>
<br>
<pre>
<img src="https://comptag.github.io/t4ds/assets/images/montanacounties.jpg" alt="The Big Sky">
</pre>
</details>

Let's get a better feel for the data. Intuitively, with this shapefile data there should be, well, a 
shape ... defining each county.

We can get the attributes of spatial polygons data (and most labelled data in R) as follows:

```
names(counties)
```

<details>
<summary style="color:blue">Expected Output</summary>
<br>
<pre style="background-color:lightblue">
<code>
> names(counties)
 [1] "NAME"       "NAMEABBR"   "COUNTYNUMB" "PKEY"       "SQMILES"    "PERIMETER" 
 [7] "ACRES"      "ALLFIPS"    "FIPS"       "LAST_UPDAT" "NAMELABEL"  "BAS_ID"    
[13] "ID_UK"      "Shape_Leng" "Shape_Area"                                      NA's   :1  
</code>
</pre>
</details>

Knowing this, we can get the name of every County using the following syntax:

```
counties$NAME
```

We can also look up the associated data given a county's index. Try this with Carbon county, at index 1.

```
counties[1,]
```

In fact, we can do this with any attribute of the counties data. Play around and get a feel for it!
Knowing an attribute of data, we can also find its index. For example, we can find the index of
Choteau county by:

```
which(counties$NAME=="CHOUTEAU")
```

<details>
<summary style="color:blue">Expected Output</summary>
<br>
<pre style="background-color:lightblue">
<code>
> which(counties$NAME=="CHOUTEAU")
[1] 40
</code>
</pre>
</details>

The `which` function also has attributes `max` and `min`. This allows us to find polygons maximizing and minimizing different attributes. For instance, the index of the county in Montana with smallest perimeter is:

```
counties$NAME[which.min(counties$PERIMETER)]
```

<details>
<summary style="color:blue">Expected Output</summary>
<br>
<pre style="background-color:lightblue">
<code>
> counties$NAME[which.min(counties$PERIMETER)]
[1] "WHEATLAND"
</code>
</pre>
</details>


Using what you know about indexing in R, dataframes, and spatial polygons, see if you can find the largest 
county (by acres) in Montana.

<details>
<summary style="color:red">See the Answer</summary>
<br>
<pre style="background-color:lightcoral">
<code>
> counties$NAME[which.max(counties$ACRES)]
[1] "BEAVERHEAD"
</code>
</pre>
</details>


Let's try to select Gallatin County specifically (which is where you are currently!). Try using the
`which` function to get the associated spatial polygons object.

```
# save Gallatin County sp object
gallatin <- # HINT: Get the index of Gallatin county, which corresponds to a row in the dataframe
```

<details>
<summary style="color:red">See the Answer</summary>
<br>
<pre style="background-color:lightcoral">
<code>
gallatin <- counties[which(counties$NAME=="GALLATIN"),]
</code>
</pre>
</details>


And visualize Gallatin County:

```
plot(gallatin)
```

<details>
<summary style="color:blue">Expected Output</summary>
<br>
<pre>
<img src="https://comptag.github.io/t4ds/assets/images/gallatin.jpg" alt="gallatin plot">

</details>

<details>
<summary style="color:DarkOrange">More Info</summary>

Another popular library for plotting is ggplot2.  It has additional parameters
you can set to customize the output.
<code>
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
ggplot() + geom_polygon(data = gallatin, aes( x = long, y = lat, group = group), fill="#B9975B", color="#00205B")
</code>

</pre>
</details>

There are tons of things we can do now with an isolated spatial polygon.
It should be noted that polygons are defined just as a set of points and a set of edges.
We can extract the set of points defining a polygon using some careful syntax:

```
coords <- gallatin@polygons[[1]]@Polygons[[1]]@coords
plot(coords)
```

<details>
<summary style="color:blue">Expected Output</summary>
<br>
<pre>
<img src="https://comptag.github.io/t4ds/assets/images/coords.jpg" alt="gallatin coords">
</pre>
</details>

We can also sample within a polygon using the `spsample` function.
Here's the syntax to do that, and subsequently plot the result:

```
gallatinSample <- spsample(gallatin,n=1000,"random")
plot(gallatinSample,pch=20,cex=.5)
```

<details>
<summary style="color:blue">Expected Output</summary>
<br>
<pre>
<img src="https://comptag.github.io/t4ds/assets/images/gallatinsample.jpg" alt="gallatin coords">
</pre>
</details>


We can also test whether not a given point lies within Gallatin County using the `point.in.polygon` function:

```
point.in.polygon(460000,150000,coords[,1],coords[,2])
point.in.polygon(1,2,coords[,1],coords[,2])
```

<details>
<summary style="color:blue">Expected Output</summary>
<br>
<pre style="background-color:lightblue">
<code>
> point.in.polygon(460000,150000,coords[,1],coords[,2])
[1] 1
> point.in.polygon(1,2,coords[,1],coords[,2])
[1] 0
</code>
</pre>
</details>

If a point is assigned a 1, then the point lies within the polygon, and if it is a 0, the point lies
outside of the polygon. This will be of great importance later on, when we conduct segmentation tasks
for topological data analysis. Stay tuned!

### Bonus: Multiple Counties

On your own, try selecting the spatial data corresponding to Flathead, Missoula, and Sanders county.
(HINT: Remember we can use the `which()` function to get the index of a given element)

```
# get the three counties surrounding Lake county, and Flathead lake.
lakeNeighbors <- # select Flathead, Missoula, and Sanders county
```

<details>
<summary style="color:red">See the Answer</summary>
<br>
<pre style="background-color:lightcoral">
<code>
lakeNeighbors <- counties[c(which(counties$NAME=="FLATHEAD"), which(counties$NAME=="MISSOULA"), which(counties$NAME=="SANDERS")), ]
</code>
</pre>
</details>

If you did this correctly, you should be able to achieve the following plot:

```
plot(lakeNeighbors)
```

<details>
<summary style="color:blue">Expected Output</summary>
<br>
<pre style="background-color:lightblue">
<img src="https://comptag.github.io/t4ds/assets/images/lakeneighbors.jpg" alt="lake">
</pre>
</details>

It may look like there are five regions, but the middle one is not a county; it
is Flathead Lake!

## 3. Wrapping Up

Thanks for following along in session 2! To look back on our accomplishments before lunch:

> - We learned about basic R programming, data structures, and visualization
> - We dealt with GIS data, which is often quite large and contains many fields
> - We visualized and played with GIS data
> - We extracted the core components in GIS data, the points defining polygons

Enjoy a long lunch in downtown Bozeman! If you have any questions about the above topics, don't hesitate 
to ask. And if you have muddy points, post them!  Before heading to lunch,
remember to save your file.
